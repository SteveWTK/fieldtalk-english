## ðŸ“Š Database Setup

### Step 1: Run SQL Scripts in Order

Run these in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **`DATABASE_UPDATES.sql`** (If not already run)
   - Creates schools, classes, conversation_topics, topic_votes, conversation_attendance tables
   - Adds school_id, class_id, client_type to players table
   - Sets up RLS policies for schools

2. **`VOTING_SCHEMA_UPDATE.sql`**
   - Creates lesson_votes table for embedded voting
   - Sets up RLS policies for voting

3. **`ACADEMIES_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`** (NEW)
   - Creates academies table
   - Adds academy_id to players table
   - Sets up RLS policies for academies

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

Check that these tables exist:
- âœ… schools
- âœ… classes
- âœ… conversation_topics
- âœ… topic_votes
- âœ… conversation_attendance
- âœ… lesson_votes
- âœ… academies

Check that players table has these columns:
- âœ… client_type (student/player)
- âœ… user_type (platform_admin/school_admin/teacher/student/client_admin/player)
- âœ… school_id
- âœ… class_id
- âœ… academy_id

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No school/academy assigned" message
**Solution:** User needs `school_id` or `academy_id` set in players table

### Issue: Lessons not showing for students/players
**Solution:** Check `client_type` in players table and `target_audience` in lessons table

### Issue: Can't access dashboard
**Solution:** Check `user_type` in players table matches required role

### Issue: RLS policy error
**Solution:** Make sure all SQL scripts ran successfully and policies were created

### Issue: Voting not working
**Solution:**
- Check `lesson_votes` table exists
- Verify RLS policies for lesson_votes
- Check step has valid `vote_deadline` in future
